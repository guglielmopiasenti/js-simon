# Description:

Display 5 different random numbers on page. From there, a 30-second timer starts.
After 30 seconds the numbers disappear and the user has to enter, one at a time, the numbers he has seen previously, using the prompt().
After the 5 numbers have been entered, the software tells how many and which of the numbers to guess have been found.

# Bonuses:

We show the 30 second countdown on the page
Let the user enter the numbers via 5 input fields instead of via prompt.

Tips of the day:

- Think first in Italian.
- Divide the delivery into small problems.
- Identify the elements you need to implement the program.
